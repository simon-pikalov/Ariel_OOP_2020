The Panda3D free 3D game engine
===============================

Panda3D is a powerful 3D engine written in C++, with a complete set of Python
bindings. Unlike other engines, these bindings are automatically generated,
meaning that they are always up-to-date and complete: all functions of the
engine can be controlled from Python. All major Panda3D applications have been
written in Python, this is the intended way of using the engine.

Panda3D now supports automatic shader generation, which now means you can use
normal maps, gloss maps, glow maps, HDR, cartoon shading, and the like without
having to write any shaders.

Panda3D is a modern engine supporting advanced features such as shaders,
stencil, and render-to-texture. Panda3D is unusual in that it emphasizes a
short learning curve, rapid development, and extreme stability and robustness.
Panda3D is free software that runs under Windows, Linux, or macOS.

The Panda3D team is very concerned with making the engine accessible to new
users. We provide a detailed manual, a complete API reference, and a large
collection of sample programs to help you get started. We have active forums,
with many helpful users, and the developers are regularly online to answer
questions.
