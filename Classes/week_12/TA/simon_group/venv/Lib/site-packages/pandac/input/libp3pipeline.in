/**
 * TypeHandle is the identifier used to differentiate C++ class types.  Any
 * C++ classes that inherit from some base class, and must be differentiated
 * at run time, should store a static TypeHandle object that can be queried
 * through a static member function named get_class_type().  Most of the time,
 * it is also desirable to inherit from TypedObject, which provides some
 * virtual functions to return the TypeHandle for a particular instance.
 *
 * At its essence, a TypeHandle is simply a unique identifier that is assigned
 * by the TypeRegistry.  The TypeRegistry stores a tree of TypeHandles, so
 * that ancestry of a particular type may be queried, and the type name may be
 * retrieved for run-time display.
