/**
 * NodePath is the fundamental system for disambiguating instances, and also
 * provides a higher-level interface for manipulating the scene graph.
 *
 * A NodePath is a list of connected nodes from the root of the graph to any
 * sub-node.  Each NodePath therefore uniquely describes one instance of a
 * node.
 *
 * NodePaths themselves are lightweight objects that may easily be copied and
 * passed by value.  Their data is stored as a series of NodePathComponents
 * that are stored on the nodes.  Holding a NodePath will keep a reference
 * count to all the nodes in the path.  However, if any node in the path is
 * removed or reparented (perhaps through a different NodePath), the NodePath
 * will automatically be updated to reflect the changes.
